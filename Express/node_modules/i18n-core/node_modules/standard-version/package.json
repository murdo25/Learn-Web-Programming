Run:\n\n```bash\n# npm run script\nnpm run release -- --prerelease\n```\nyou will get version `1.0.1-0`.\n\nIf you want to name the pre-release, you specify the name via `--prerelease <name>`.\n\nFor example, suppose your pre-release should contain the `alpha` prefix:\n\n```bash\n# npm run script\nnpm run release -- --prerelease alpha\n```\n\nthis will tag the version `1.0.1-alpha.0`\n\n### Release as a target type imperatively like `npm version`\n\nTo forgo the automated version bump use `--release-as` with the argument `major`, `minor` or `patch`:\n\nSuppose the last version of your code is `1.0.0`, you've only landed `fix:` commits, but\nyou would like your next release to be a `minor`. Simply do:\n\n```bash\n# npm run script\nnpm run release -- --release-as minor\n```\n\nyou will get version `1.1.0` rather than the auto generated version `1.0.1`.\n\n> **NOTE:** you can combine `--release-as` and `--prerelease` to generate a release. This is useful when publishing experimental feature(s).\n\n### Prevent Git Hooks\n\nIf you use git hooks, like pre-commit, to test your code before committing, you can prevent hooks from being verified during the commit step by passing the `--no-verify` option:\n\n```sh\n# npm run script\nnpm run release -- --no-verify\n# or global bin\nstandard-version --no-verify\n```\n\n### Signing commits and tags\n\nIf you have your GPG key set up, add the `--sign` or `-s` flag to your `standard-version` command.\n\n### Committing generated artifacts in the release commit\n\nIf you want to commit generated artifacts in the release commit (e.g. [#96](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version/issues/96)), you can use the `--commit-all` or `-a` flag. You will need to stage the artifacts you want to commit, so your `release` command could look like this:\n\n```json\n\"prerelease\": \"webpack -p --bail\",\n\"release\": \"git add <file(s) to commit> && standard-version -a\"\n```\n\n### CLI Help\n\n```sh\n# npm run script\nnpm run release -- --help\n# or global bin\nstandard-version --help\n```\n\n## Code usage\n\nUse the `silent` option to stop `standard-version` from printing anything\nto the console.\n\n```js\nvar standardVersion = require('standard-version')\n\n// Options are the same as command line, except camelCase\nstandardVersion({\n  noVerify: true,\n  infile: 'docs/CHANGELOG.md',\n  silent: true\n}, function (err) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(`standard-version failed with message: ${err.message}`)\n  }\n  // standard-version is done\n})\n```\n\n## Commit Message Convention, at a Glance\n\n_patches:_\n\n```sh\ngit commit -a -m \"fix(parsing): fixed a bug in our parser\"\n```\n\n_features:_\n\n```sh\ngit commit -a -m \"feat(parser): we now have a parser \\o/\"\n```\n\n_breaking changes:_\n\n```sh\ngit commit -a -m \"feat(new-parser): introduces a new parsing library\nBREAKING CHANGE: new library does not support foo-construct\"\n```\n\n_other changes:_\n\nYou decide, e.g., docs, chore, etc.\n\n```sh\ngit commit -a -m \"docs: fixed up the docs a bit\"\n```\n\n_but wait, there's more!_\n\nGithub usernames (`@bcoe`) and issue references (#133) will be swapped out for the\nappropriate URLs in your CHANGELOG.\n\n## Badges!\n\nTell your users that you adhere to the `standard-version` commit guidelines:\n\n```markdown\n[![Standard Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-standard%20version-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How is `standard-version` different from `semantic-release`?\n\n[`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) is a fully automated library/system for versioning, changelog generation, git tagging, and publishing to the npm registry.\n\n`standard-version` is different because it handles the versioning, changelog generation, and git tagging for you **without** automatic pushing (to GitHub) or publishing (to an npm registry). Use of `standard-version` only affects your local git repo - it doesn't affect remote resources at all. After you run `standard-version`, you still have to ability to review things and correct mistakes if you want to.\n\nThey are both based on the same foundation of structured commit messages (using [Angular format](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-changelog-standard/blob/master/convention.md)), but `standard-version` is a good choice for folks who are not yet comfortable letting publishes go out automatically. In this way, you can view `standard-version` as an incremental step to adopting `semantic-release`.\n\nWe think they are both fantastic tools, and we encourage folks to use `semantic-release` instead of `standard-version` if it makes sense for them.\n\n### Should I always squash commits when merging PRs?\n\nThe instructions to squash commits when merging pull requests assumes that **one PR equals, at most, one feature or fix**.\n\nIf you have multiple features or fixes landing in a single PR and each commit uses a structured message, then you can do a standard merge when accepting the PR. This will preserve the commit history from your branch after the merge.\n\nAlthough this will allow each commit to be included as separate entries in your CHANGELOG, the entries will **not** be able to reference the PR that pulled the changes in because the preserved commit messages do not include the PR number.\n\nFor this reason, we recommend keeping the scope of each PR to one general feature or fix. In practice, this allows you to use unstructured commit messages when committing each little change and then squash them into a single commit with a structured message (referencing the PR number) once they have been reviewed and accepted.\n\n## License\n\nISC\n",
